# 为多人联机适配模组

## 声明

为了声明您的模组支持多人联机，您需要在启动脚本`launcher.js`中调用`ConfigureMultiplayer(configuration)`函数。这个函数必须在`Launch(...)`之前执行才能生效。调用该函数时，您可以指定`name`和`version`参数。游戏将根据这两个参数来识别网络游戏中不同的模组。如果两者中有任何一个没有指定，游戏都会从`mod.info`中相同字段处读取来代替这个参数。此外，如果存在`isClientOnly: true`参数，模组会被声明为纯客户端模组。客户端模组不会影响世界，也不会在联机后模组在客户端和服务端同步数据时考虑在内（例如：小地图、R键合成和WAILA等）。

```js
ConfigureMultiplayer({
    name: "readable unique name", //模组在网络间的唯一名称
    version: "version", //模组的版本
    isClientOnly: true/false //如果为 true，模组会被视作纯客户端模组
});
```

## 一般概念

为了使游戏能在网络游戏中正常工作，模组代码本应被划分为客户端和服务端两部分。除了网络数据包和网络实体的事件之外，两者不会以其他任何方式进行交互。这意味着模组的客户端无法使用服务端代码中的任何变量和函数等内容，反之亦然。

服务端应负责所有的代码逻辑和世界处理工作，而客户端则应负责基于服务端递来数据的可视化工作，并向服务端递送客户端的自定行为。

然而，如果你使用这个新的API，许多标准对象例如方块实体、容器、盔甲等都已经为多人联机适配好了。

当您载入自己的世界时，连接在该世界上的服务端和客户端将在同一台设备上启动。当您连入其他人的世界时，将仅有一个客户端在您自己的设备上启动，这个客户端与主机上正在运行的服务端相连接。

## 网络数据包的传输和处理

实现多人联机的基本网络机理是数据包的传输，即客户端和服务端互相之间命名数据的传输。您可以注册一个事件来接收客户端或服务端递来的指定名称的数据包。每当相应名称数据包到达时，事件便会触发。

```js
//当数据包 testMod.serverMessage 从服务端到达客户端时，该事件便会触发
Network.addClientPacket("testMod.serverMessage", function(packetData) {
    //我们已知将要到达的对象长成这个样子{sender: ..., text: ...}
    Game.message("[" + packetData.sender + "]" + packetData.text);
});

//一个向所有玩家发送一条消息的函数
function sendMessageToAll(sender, text) {
    //从服务端向所有客户端发送一个数据包 testMod.serverMessage
    Network.sendToAllClients("testMod.serverMessage", {
        sender: sender,
        text: text
    });
}
```

类似地，你可以从客户端向服务端发送数据包。

```js
//当数据包 testMod.clientMessage 从客户端到达服务端时，该事件便会触发
Network.addServerPacket("testMod.clientMessage", function(client, data)) {
    //以数据包来源的客户端玩家为发送者的身份向所有客户端发送一条消息
    sendMessageToAll(client.getPlayerUid(), data.text);
});

//一个向服务端发送一条玩家消息的客户端函数，这条消息将以该玩家为发送者的身份被发送到所有玩家的客户端上
function sendMessageFromClient(message) {
    //从客户端向服务端发送一个数据包
    Network.sendToServer("testMod.clientMessage", {text: message});
}
```

在上一个例子的情形下，我们看到`client`参数出现在由服务端接收数据包的事件当中。这个参数便是代表着数据包来源的客户端接口。它可以用于获取玩家实体（通过`client.getPlayerUid()`）。此外，通过它您还可以向一个指定的客户端发送数据包，而非一次性向全员发送。如果您已经知道了一个玩家的ID，还可以通过`Network.getClientForPlayer(playerUid)`来获得他所在的客户端。

```js
//为木棍注册一个Use函数
Item.registerUseFunctionForID(280, function(coords, item, block, player) {
    //获取正在使用物品的那个玩家的客户端接口
    var client = Network.getClientForPlayer(player);
    //首先确保它是存在的
    if(client! = null) {
        //然后专门为此客户端发送一条消息
        client.send("testMod.serverMessage", {
            sender: "server debug", //发送者是 server debug
            text: "you just used stick!" //随便加上一些文本
        });
    }
});
```

## 转换方块和物品ID

同一个方块或物品在服务端和客户端上的数字ID可能会不一样。Inner Core自身的代码会自动同步ID，所以同一个物品在不同设备上的ID差异不会对原版游戏造成什么影响。但是，如果ID是以数字形式通过数据包传输的，那么模组中得到的它们的值将会不同，必须手动转换。

因为客户端可能有很多，而服务端只有一个，所以转换需要发生在客户端。为此我们有函数`Network.serverToLocalId(id)`和`Network.localToServerId(id)`。前者将服务端ID转换成该客户端ID，后者方向相反。

考虑一个例子来说明这件事：

```js
//一个从服务端传输到客户端的数据包，包含物品使用信息（例如，我们就只传递ID和特殊值）
Network.addClientPacket("testMod.useItemInfo", function() {
    // display information: first the id that the server sent us, then the id that this item has on the client, to confirm that this is the same item on the client, we get its name by the client id
    var localId = Network.serverToLocalId(packetData.id);
    Game.message("you just used item: server =" + packetData.id + "client =" + localId + "name =" + Item.getName(localId, packetData.data));
});

// server event of item use
Callback.addCallback("ItemUse", function(coords, item, block, isExternal, player) {
    var client = Network.getClientForPlayer(player);
    if(client! = null) {
        // send a packet with the item data, since the event is purely server-side, this will be the server-side id of the item
        client.send("testMod.useItemInfo", {id: item.id, data: item.data});
    }
});
```

In order to test this example in practice, you need two devices, because a pair of client and server that run on the same device will have the same id. To force different ids on two devices, you can try changing the `innercore/mods/.staticid` file

## Tile Entity adaptation

The main logic of Tile Entity runs on the server side. However, you can declare a separate prototype for the client. According to this prototype, an instance will be created for clients who have this Tile Entity nearby, have events of appearance, tick and destruction, which allows you to add a visual component.

Since the old container, which was used by Tile Entity earlier, does not support multiplayer, in order for Tile Entity to support network play, it needs to be transferred to a new container type - ItemContainer. The new container type is compatible with old saves.

The following is the documentation for the Tile Entity network prototype, the events that are omitted here are server side.

```js
{
    // server side prototype

    useNetworkItemContainer: true, // allow the use of a container with multiplayer support

    defaultValues: {
        // stored values
    },

    // initialization
    init: function() {
        // The following fields are available inside the server Tile Entity:
        // this.x, this.y, this.z, this.dimension - coordinates and dimension
        // this.data - all stored values
        // this.container is the ItemContainer object
        // this.blockSource - BlockSource object for accessing the dimension in which this Tile Entity is located
        // this.networkData - SyncedNetworkData object synchronized data available to all clients
        // this.networkEntity is a NetworkEntity object representing the network entity that this Tile Entity is based on, only needed for advanced operations, usually not required

        // Network methods
        // this.sendPacket("eventName", data) - Sends a packet to all client instances of this Tile Entity
    },

    // this event is called on the server side and returns the name of the interface to open on click
    getScreenName: function(player, coords) {
        return "someName";
    },

    // this event is called on the client side, `this` is not defined in this case, by the passed name returned by the getScreenName method, it returns the window that needs to be opened
    getScreenByName: function(screenName) {
        return someGuiWindow;
    },

    client: {
        // client Tile Entity instance prototype, an instance is created for each client, every time the Tile Entity becomes visible on the client side and is destroyed every time it becomes invisible.

        // called when the instance is created
        load: function() {
            // The following fields are available inside the client Tile Entity:
            // this.x, this.y, this.z, this.dimension - coordinates and dimension
            // this.networkData - SyncedNetworkData object synchronized data available to all clients
            // this.networkEntity is a NetworkEntity object representing the network entity that this Tile Entity is based on, only needed for advanced operations, usually not required

            // container and world access are not available on the client side

            // Network methods
            // this.sendPacket("eventName", data) - Sends a packet to the server Tile Entity instance
        },

        // called when the instance is destroyed
        unload: function() {

        },

        // every tick is called on the local thread, it is worth considering, the loads on the local thread have a greater impact on performance
        tick: function() {

        },

        events: {
            // events that receive packets on the client side, in this case `this` will be the client instance that received this packet
            packetName: function(packetData, packetExtra) {

            }
        },

        containerEvents: {
            // events of the client container instance, `this` is undefined
            // these events are for editing the contents of the window
            eventName: function(container, window, windowContent, eventData) {
                // window and windowContent can be null
                // To send data to the server container.sendEvent("eventName", someData)
            }
        }
    },

    events: {
        // events that receive packets on the server side, in this case `this` is the server instance that received the packet
        packetName: function(packetData, packetExtra, connectedClient) {
            // method available only here, sends a packet to a specific client: this.sendResponse("packetName", someData)
        }
    },

    containerEvents: {
        // container events on the server side, in this case `this` is the server instance that received the package

        eventName: function(eventData, connectedClient) {
            // method available only here: this.container.sendResponseEvent("eventName", someData)
        }
    }
}
```

Let's look at a few examples, starting with the simplest. In the examples, the interface window declaration will be omitted, since no changes are required in this scope, the variable containing it will be named `guiExample`.

An example of the simplest Tile Entity with an interface and basic container logic.

```js
{
    useNetworkItemContainer: true, // use a network container

    getScreenName: function(player, coords) {
        // we only have one version of the interface, let's call it "main"
        return "main";
    },

    getScreenByName: function(screenName) {
        // we only have an interface named "main"
        return screenName == "main" ? guiExample : null;
        // in addition, it is possible without checking the name:
        return guiExample;
    },

    tick: function() {
        // in the server tick, we will perform the basic logic on the container:
        if (World.getThreadTime() % 20 == 0) {
            var slot = this.container.getSlot("someSlot");
            if (slot.id == 264) {
                // you need to apply slot changes through setSlot so that the container registers them, just changing the object's fields(slot.count--) will not be counted
                this.container.setSlot("someSlot", slot.id, slot.count - 1, slot.data, slot.extra);
                // slot validation: if the count is 0, clear the slot
                this.container.validateSlot("someSlot");
                // here you can do some other server logic
            }
        }
        // send all changes to the container to clients so that they display the current content, this function sends only the changed slots and values, which happens quickly, so it can be called at the end of each tick if changes could occur on the server side
        this.container.sendChanges();
    }
}
```

Now let's look at using the Tile Entity network events. The following example demonstrates the use of a client prototype and network events to create particle animations and is a continuation of the previous one (only the places to be shown will be shown).

```js
{
    ...
    client: {
        // add a client prototype that will be responsible for animations
        events: {
            // event that receives the animateParticles packet
            animateParticles: function(packetData) {
                // create fire particles in the amount of  packetData.power
                for(var i = 0; i <packetData.power; i ++) {
                    Particles.addParticle(7, this.x + .5, this.y + .5, this.z + .5, Math.random() - .5, Math.random() - .5, Math.random() - .50);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    tick: function() {
        ...
        if(slot.id == 264) {
            ...
            // on successful operation, send an animation event to all clients
            this.sendPacket("animateParticles", {power: 100});
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

## Working with the world and BlockSource

Since in a network game (and in fact, in some cases in a single-player game), it is required to simultaneously access several dimensions at the same time, instead of working with the world through the `World` module，it comes `BlockSource` - a region object that allows access to blocks and mobs of a specific dimension.

> *IMPORTANT!* Working through the `World` module anywhere other than world generation events will most likely lead to incorrect behavior if the players are in different dimensions. During generation, methods from the `World` and `GenerationUtils` modules always work in the correct dimension.

### Basic Methods

- `int getDimension()` - returns the id of the dimension to which this object belongs
- `int getBlockId(x, y, z)` - gets block id by coordinates
- `int getBlockData(x, y, z)` - gets block method data by coordinates
- `void setBlock(x, y, z, id, data)` - sets the block to coordinates
- `NativeTileEntity getBlockEntity(x, y, z)` - returns the interface to the vanilla Tile Entity (chest, furnance, etc.)
- `int getBiome(x, z)` - returns the id of the biome by coordinates
- `void setBiome(x, z, id)` - sets the id of the biome by coordinates
- `float getBiomeTemperatureAt(x, y, z)` - returns the biome temperature by coordinates
- `boolean isChunkLoaded(chunkX, chunkZ)` - returns whether the chunk is loaded by the chunk coordinates
- `boolean isChunkLoadedAt(x, z)` - returns whether the chunk is loaded by the block coordinates
- `int getChunkState(chunkX, chunkZ)` - returns the chunk loading state by the chunk coordinates
- `int getChunkStateAt(x, z)` - returns the chunk loading state by block coordinates
- `boolean canSeeSky(x, y, z)` - returns whether the sky is visible from a given point
- `int getGrassColor(x, z)` - returns the color of the grass
- `void destroyBlock(x, y, z[, drop])` - destroys the block at coordinates, if `drop` is `true`, then the block drops resources as if destroyed by a non-player
- `void explode(x, y, z, power[, fire])` - produces an explosion at coordinates
- `long spawnEntity(x, y, z, int type)` - creates an entity by numeric type and returns
- `long spawnEntity(x, y, z, string type)` - creates an entity by string type and returns it, syntax options: `type_name`, `namespace:type_name`, `namespace:type_name:init_data`
- `long spawnEntity(x, y, z, namespace, typeName, initData)` - creates an entity by namespace, type name and initialization data and returns it
- `long spawnDroppedItem(x, y, z, id, count, data[, extra)` - creates a dropped item and returns the id of the entity
- `void spawnExpOrbs(x, y, z, expAmount)` - creates an experience orb on coordinates, with a total value of `expAmount`
- `long[] listEntititesInAABB(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2[, type[, blacklist]])` - returns a list of entity ids in a given box that correspond to the given type `type` if the `blacklist` value is `false`, and all, except for entities not of this type, if `blacklist` is `true`

### Methods for random access to BlockSource

- `BlockSource.getDefaultForDimension(dimension)` - returns the interface to this default dimension. Returns `null` if the given dimension is not loaded and this interface has not been created yet.
- `BlockSource.getDefaultForActor(entityUid)` - returns the interface to the dimension in which the entity is located, returns `null` if the entity does not exist or this dimension has not been loaded and the interface has not been created.

### BlockSource and Tile Entity

First of all, we are faced with this object in the Tile Entity, each server instance has a `blockSource` field that contains an interface to the dimension in which it is located. *IMPORTANT!* All work with the world in this Tile Entity must be done through its `BlockSource`.

## Changed Multiplayer Events

Many events now take the id of the player's entity performing the action, or a `BlockSource` object that provides access to the dimension where the event occurs.

### Logged events

- `Item.registerUseFunction` - the registered event takes the player who uses an item as the 4th parameter
- `Item.registerNoTargetUseFunction` - the registered event takes the player who uses an item as the 2nd parameter
- `Item.registerUsingReleasedFunction` - the registered event takes the player who uses an item as the 3rd parameter
- `Item.registerUsingCompleteFunction` - the registered event takes the player who uses an item as the 2nd parameter
- `Item.registerDispenseFunction` - the registered event takes the player using the item as the 3rd parameter
- `Block.registerDropFunction` - the event being registered takes the `BlockSource` object as the 7th parameter
- `Block.registerPlaceFunction` - the event being registered takes a player as the 4th parameter and a `BlockSource` object as the 5th parameter
- `Block.registerPopResourcesFunction` - the event being registered gets a `BlockSource` object as the 3rd parameter
- `Block.setRandomTickCallback` - the event being registered gets a `BlockSource` object as the 6th parameter
- `Block.registerNeighbourChangeFunction` - the event being registered gets a `BlockSource` object as the 4th parameter
- `World.registerBlockChangeCallback` - the event being registered gets a `BlockSource` object as the 4th parameter
- the `click` event of TileEntity takes a player as the 5th parameter

### Events added via `Callback.addCallback`

- `ItemUse` - the event takes the player who uses an item as the 5th parameter
- `DestroyBlock` - the event takes the player who breaks a block as the 3rd parameter
- `FoodEaten` - the event takes a player as the 3rd parameter
- `ExpAdd` - the event takes a player as the 2nd parameter

- `PlayerAttack` - the event takes a player as the 1st parameter
- `EntityInteract` - the event takes a player as the 2nd parameter
- `ItemUseNoTarget` - the event takes a player as the 2nd parameter
- `ItemUsingReleased` - the event takes a player as the 3rd parameter
- `ItemUsingComplete` - the event takes a player as the 2nd parameter
- `ExpLevelAdd` - the event takes a player as the 2nd parameter
- `RedstoneSignal` - the event takes a `BlockSource` object as the 4th parameter
- `PopBlockResources` - event accepts a `BlockSource` object as the 5th parameter
- `BlockEventNeighbourChange` - the event takes a `BlockSource` object as the 4th parameter
- `ItemDispensed` - the event takes a `BlockSource` object as the 3rd parameter

## Working with SyncedNetworkData in Tile Entity

Both the server and client Tile Entity instances have a `networkData` field that represents data synchronized between the server and all clients and allows them to be caught and validated.

### Communication Methods

- `int getInt(key[, fallback])` - gets the value by key
- `long getLong(key[, fallback])` - gets the value by key
- `float getFloat(key[, fallback])` - gets the value by key
- `double getDouble(key[, fallback])` - gets the value by key
- `String getString(key[, fallback])` - gets the value by key
- `boolean getBoolean(key[, fallback])` - gets the value by key
- `void putInt(key, value)` - sets the value by key
- `void putLong(key, value)` - sets the value by key
- `void putFloat(key, value)` - sets the value by key
- `void putDouble(key, value)` - sets the value by key
- `void putString(key, value)` - sets the value by key
- `void putBoolean(key, value)` - sets the value by key
- `void sendChanges()` - send changed data

### Developments

You can add an event to the `SyncedNetworkData` object that catches changes in any data, this event can be set both on the server side (in the `init` event of the server Tile Entity instance), and on the client side (in the `load` event of the client Tile Entity instance).

```js
this.networkData.addOnDataChangedListener(function(networkData, isExternalChange) {
    // networkData is the SyncedNetworkData object that changed
    // isExternalChange - false if the change was made by calling put from this object, true if it came over the network from another attached data object
});
```

In addition, validators can be added to the server object `SyncedNetworkData` - methods that check the change that came from the client and can confirm it, change or deny it. This is for security reasons so that clients cannot send incorrect data to the server using modified mods.

You can install the validator in the `init` event of the server Tile Entity instance:

```js
this.networkData.addVerifier(key, function(key, newValue) {
    // the validator returns the value that will be set to the data
    // just use return newValue to pass the value;
    // use return null to undo the change;
    // you can return any other value and it will be set
});
```

If a field in the server synchronized data needs to be blocked from being changed by clients, you can do it as follows:

```js
this.networkData.addVerifier(key, function(key, newValue) {return null;});
```

### Example

Consider a Tile Entity as an example, which displays a model of an item above itself that lies in its slot.

```js
{
    // use the network container implementation
    useNetworkItemContainer: true,

    client: {
        updateModel: function() {
            // update the model using networkData
            // don't forget about converting item ids from server to client
            var id = Network.serverToLocalId(this.networkData.getInt("itemId"));
            var data = this.networkData.getInt("itemData");
            this.model.describeItem({
                id: id, count: 1, data: data, size: 1
            });
        },

        load: function() {
            // create a model when creating a client instance
            this.model = new Animation.Item(this.x + .5, this.y + 1.5, this.z + .5);
            this.updateModel();
            this.model.load();

            // add a data change event
            var that = this;
            this.networkData.addOnDataChangedListener(function(data, isExternal) {
                // update the model when the data changes
                that.updateModel();
            });
        },

        // destroy the model when the instance is destroyed
        unload: function() {
            this.model.destroy();
        }
    },

    tick: function() {
        // update the data every 10 ticks so as not to overload
        if(World.getThreadTime()% 10 == 0) {
            // get the slot
            var slot = this.container.getSlot("someSlot");
            // transfer data via networkData
            this.networkData.putInt("itemId", slot.id);
            this.networkData.putInt("itemData", slot.data);
            // send changes to clients
            this.networkData.sendChanges();
        }
    }

    // methods for opening the interface are present, but are not important for the example
}
```

## Player tick and other events

Since many operations are required to be performed for each player separately, an additional `ServerPlayerTick` event has been introduced. This event is called on the server side every tick for every player. The following is an example of adding an event:

```js
Callback.addCallback("ServerPlayerTick", function(playerUid, isPlayerDead) {
    // playerUid - player entity
    // isPlayerDead - additional parameter - whether this player is dead
    var client = Network.getClientForPlayer(playerUid);
    if(client! = null) {
        // do something
    }
});
```

In addition, there is a client tick event, which is called every tick of the client stream - `LocalTick`. All client actions of the tick must take place in it, in particular, by the player's custom movement.

```js
Callback.addCallback("LocalTick", function() {
    // local player can be obtained via Player.get()
});
```

The `DimensionLoaded` and `DimensionUnloaded` events are deprecated because not suitable for multiplayer games, they are replaced by the server event `PlayerChangedDimension`, which is called when the player is loaded in a dimension or when switching between dimensions.

```js
Callback.addCallback("PlayerChangedDimension", function (playerUid, currentId, lastId) {
     // playerUid - the player who changed the dimension
     // currentId - the dimension the player is currently in
     // lastId - the dimension the player was in, if this event was triggered when the player was loaded, then currentId == lastId
});
```

## Player interface

The server side needs to handle different players, so the `Player` module is no longer relevant in a network game. It is replaced by the `PlayerActor` object, which allows you to create a temporary player interface.

> *IMPORTANT!* The `PlayerActor` object is temporary and valid for 1 server tick, after that, if the player disconnects, using it may cause a crash. Therefore, every tick you need to create a new object. Besides

### Example

```js
Callback.addCallback("ServerPlayerTick", function(playerUid, isPlayerDead) {
    // every tick we create a new interface for subsequent use
    var player = new PlayerActor(playerUid);
});

## Armor

Since the old methods of registering armor events were not suitable for multiplayer, new registration functions have been added, which are listed below.

```js
Armor.registerOnTickListener(id, function(item, slot, player) {
    // this event is triggered every tick for every player wearing this armor
    // this event can return an object of the type {id:, count:, data:, extra:} to change the item of armor, if nothing is returned, then the armor will not be changed
});
```

```js
Armor.registerOnHurtListener(id, function(item, slot, player, value, type, attacker, bool1, bool2) {
    // this event is triggered when damage is dealt to a player wearing armor
    // this event can return an object of the form {id:, count:, data:, extra:} to change the item of armor, if nothing is returned, then the armor will be damaged in the standard way
});
```

```js
Armor.registerOnTakeOnListener(id, function(item, slot, player) {
    // this event is triggered when the player puts on armor or spawns with it
});
```

```js
Armor.registerOnTakeOffListener(id, function(item, slot, player) {
    // this event is triggered when the player removes or replaces this piece of armor
});
```
